# Polymath-Swarm-Dynamic-Mixture-of-Experts-via-O-TITANS-MoOLE-T-
The Polymath Swarm introduces the MoOLE-T architecture (Mixture-of-Orthogonal-LoRA-Experts with TITANS routing). Instead of one massive brain, we use a lightweight cognitive router to dynamically hot-swap hyper-specialized "Engrams" onto a mid-sized synthesis core in real-time.
